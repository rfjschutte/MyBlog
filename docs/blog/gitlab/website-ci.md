# Continuous Integration Pipelines with GitLab CI

## introduction

GitLab Community Edition is a self-hosted Git provider
with additional features to help with project
management and software development. One of the most
valuable features that GitLab offers is the builtin
continuous integration and delivery tool called
GitLab CI. With GitLab CI each commit triggers a
build during which tests are run that help to identify
if anything was broken by the changes.
