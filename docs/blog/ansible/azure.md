# Ansible in Azure

Ansible includes a suite of Ansible modules that
can be executed directly on remote hosts or via
playbooks. Users can also create their own modules.
Modules can be used to control system resources
such as services, packages, or files - or
execute system commands.

For interacting with Azure services, Ansible includes
a suite of Ansible cloud modules that provides the
tools to easily create and orchestrate your
infrastructure on Azure.
